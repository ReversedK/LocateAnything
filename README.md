**Use just any
taxonomy as a filter**

Easily use any
taxonomy (custom taxonomies or regular taxonomies) to filter your
maps.

Post Types**

Most of the
WordPress plugins only support posts and pages. Not this plugin!
Total support for any custom post type and their taxonomies!

**Fully
customizable marker icons**

You can define a
custom marker icon for each location or choose to use the same marker
for the whole map. It’s up to you!

Choose between the
plugin’s predefined marker icons, create your own markers using
Ionicon or just use any image from the media library. Total
flexibility!

**Customizable Map
Overlay**

Choose between 4
different map overlays… Or use any overlay you want with the Custom
Overlay Addon

**Additional fields**

Need to display a
specific info on the map? Create additional fields! Additional fields
are custom fields specifically designed to be displayed on the map.

Let’s say your map
is about coffeshops and you want to show the opening hours and the
name of the nearest subway station? Create 2 additional fields :
openingHours and nearestSubway. Done! Those informations are ready to
be displayed in the marker list and the tooltips.

**Fully

tooltips EXACTLY as you want them : HTML, audios, videos, images,post
