* **Developer-friendly** : 
LocateAnything has been built with extensibility in mind : addons using LocateAnything
in conjunction with another WP plugin  typically are less than 300 lines of code.  
* **Use just any taxonomy as a filter** : Easily use any taxonomy (custom taxonomies or regular taxonomies) to filter your maps.
* **Supports Custom Post Types** : Most of the WordPress plugins only support posts and pages. Not this one!Total support for any custom post type and their taxonomies!
* **Fully customizable marker icons** : You can define a custom marker icon for each location or choose to use the same marker for the whole map. It’s up to you! Choose between the plugin’s predefined marker icons, create your own markers using Ionicon or just use any image from the media library. Total flexibility!
* **Customizable Map Overlay** : Choose between 4 different map overlays… Or use any overlay you want with the Custom Overlay Addon
* **Additional fields** : Need to display a specific info on the map? Create additional fields! Additional fields are custom fields specifically designed to be displayed on the map. Let’s say your map is about coffeshops and you want to show the opening hours and the name of the nearest subway station? Create 2 additional fields : openingHours and nearestSubway. Done! Those informations are ready to be displayed in the marker list and the tooltips.
* **Fully customizable tooltips** : Customize the tooltips EXACTLY as you want them : HTML, audios, videos, images,post content… Tooltips can display nearly anything. Customize the tooltip template for each marker independently, you have total control on the information that appears…or use a tooltip preset for instant styling!
