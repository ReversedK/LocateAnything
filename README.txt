== Description ==

**Use just any
taxonomy as a filter**

Easily use any
taxonomy (custom taxonomies or regular taxonomies) to filter your
maps.

**Supports Custom
Post Types**

Most of the
WordPress plugins only support posts and pages. Not this plugin!
Total support for any custom post type and their taxonomies!

**Fully
customizable marker icons**

You can define a
custom marker icon for each location or choose to use the same marker
for the whole map. It’s up to you!

plugin’s predefined marker icons, create your own markers using
Ionicon or just use any image from the media library. Total
flexibility!

**Customizable Map
Overlay**

different map overlays… Or use any overlay you want with the Custom
Overlay Addon

**Additional fields**

Need to display a
specific info on the map? Create additional fields! Additional fields
are custom fields specifically designed to be displayed on the map.

Let’s say your map
is about coffeshops and you want to show the opening hours and the
name of the nearest subway station? Create 2 additional fields :
openingHours and nearestSubway. Done! Those informations are ready to
be displayed in the marker list and the tooltips.

**Fully
customizable tooltips**

Customize the
tooltips EXACTLY as you want them : HTML, audios, videos, images,post
content… Tooltips can display nearly anything.

Customize the
tooltip template for each marker independently, you have total
control on the information that appears…or use a tooltip preset for
instant styling!

list as you please : HTML, audios, videos, images,post content…
