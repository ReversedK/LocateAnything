Tokenize
==========

jQuery Tokenize is a plugin which allows your users to select multiple items from a predefined list or ajax, using autocompletion as they type to find each item. You may have seen a similar type of text entry when filling in the recipients field sending messages on facebook or tags on tumblr.

 - Intuitive UI for selecting multiple items from a large list
 - Easy to skin / style purely in css, no images required
 - Supports any backend which can generate JSON, including PHP, Rails, Django, ASP.net
 - Callbacks when items are added or removed from the list
 - Select, delete and navigate items using the mouse or keyboard
